## demoHybridMyMblOrgnzr
Demo app using WebView in a Hybrid Android app

###### Acknowledgements
The web app portion of this demo app is mostly the client-side teaching app freely available from the book [Pro iOS and Android Apps for Business with jQuery Mobile, node.js, and MongoDB](http://www.apress.com/9781430260707) by Frank Zammetti, augmented with additional features. Code for the web app portion is in the `./assets/www/` folder.

In order to run the web app portion of the demo app, we also use the server-side teaching app from the above book, with some minor fixes in the db schema for 'note' and for a typo in the console log message for the GET() function. Code for the server, which is run separately as the backend, is in the `./server/` folder for convenience.

This demo app also uses two Java classes (plus a couple more dependent classes) from the open source [karura](https://github.com/karuradev/karura) framework. The demo app demonstrates some of the many good ideas and pointers described in the karura framework's companion book (which contains not much actual code examples), but does not use the framework per se. We use four Java classes from the framework, and they are placed in the `./src/com/karura/framework/` path as required by their package.

###### git configuration
Our code was written on Mac OS X. But it appears that code from the Pro iOS and Android Apps book was written on Windows. To avoid very annoying line-ending characters showing up when you do "git diff", set the following git configuration for [Dealing with line endings](https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings). Be aware that git would issue a warning when it does a transparent replacement of line-ending characters, but git would also explain that the file will have its original line endings in your working directory; so don't be alarmed by such warnings.

* On Mac OS X
```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```
* On Windows
```
git config --global core.autocrlf true
```

#### Steps to run demo app

##### Downloads and installation
* Clone this repository to get your own local git repo at `[PathToGitRepoBase]/`
* Download Eclipse ADT from [Get the Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html), if you don't have it
* Go here to [Install Node.js](http://nodejs.org).
* Go here to [Install MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).
* Get MongoDB object modeling for Node.js by installing Mongoose module
```
npm install mongoose
```

##### Set up USB debugging
* Connect up your smartphone to your host development computer using USB (see [Using Hardware Devices](http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html))
* Set up remote debugging:
 * First do [Enable USB debugging on your Android device](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#enable-usb-debugging)
 * On development Host machine, start Chrome browser (v36+), then do [Enable USB discovery in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#enable-usb-discovery)
 * Now, do [Connect your device via USB](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#connect-device-via-usb)
 * At this point, we should see on Host browser's `chrome://inspect` page, the Android device, e.g. Nexus 4, listed in Devices

##### In Eclipse ADT
* Create a new project by doing `File > Import > Existing Android Code into Workspace > Root directory: [PathToGitRepoBase]/demoHybridMyMblOrgnzr > Open > Finish` (don't import as existing projects into workspace)
* In project (default project name given by Eclipse is MainActivity) `Properties > Android > in Project Build Target` we have specified the latest non-preview Android platform, currently Android 4.4.W or API Level 20. Use `Window > Android SDK Manager` to verify that you have downloaded the required SDK platform. (Note that this Project Build Target does not appear to have to be the same as the `android:targetSdkVersion` specified in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.)
* There should be no build errors for the project at this point. If there is, try checking project's `Properties > Java Build Path`
* At this point, we should be able to run the demo app on the Android device, but until the rest of the setup steps are done, be aware that the app will show an error Alert popup displaying some json object values such as `XHR:{"readyState":0...` as well as a `No Network Connection` error Dialog. But to verify that the demo app runs:
 * Right-click on this project name `(MainActivity) > Run As > Android Application > Choose a running Android device: pick your Android device > OK`
 * Dismiss the error Alert and the error Dialog
 * See the demo app's main activity screen, comprising a WebView occupying most of the screen, two bar-buttons at the bottom of the screen, and an empty TextView immediately above them.

##### Run backend for the web app portion of the demo app
The backend processes *MUST be run in the following order* (see `./server/run.bat` for Windows)
* Open Terminal (e.g. iTerm2 for a Mac) to run MongoDB daemon
```
cd [PathToGitRepoBase]/demoHybridMyMblOrgnzr/server/
sudo mongod --dbpath ./db/
Password:[enteradminpassword]
```
* Open another Terminal to run Node.js server code that is in main.js (e.g. iTerm2 for Mac, menu Shell > Split Horizontally With Current Profile)
```
cd [PathToGitRepoBase]/demoHybridMyMblOrgnzr/server/
sudo node ./main.js

App available at http://127.0.0.1:80
```

##### Set up Port forwarding between Android device and development Host
* Chrome for Android supports [Port forwarding](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging#reverse-port-forwarding)
 * First, start Chrome for Android (v35+) on the Android device
 * On development Host browser's `chrome://inspect` page, we should now see the Chrome for Android listed under the Android device; follow "Enable port forwarding" section in above "Port forwarding" link, and set `Device Port: 8080`, set `Host IP address and port: 127.0.0.1:80`
 * Make sure to check "Enable port forwarding" checkmark before hitting "Done" in the dialog popup for "Port forwarding"
 * At this point, we should see on Host browser's `chrome://inspect` page, a green circle indicating port forwarding success

##### Test web app connectivity
* To restart the demo app after connectivity is set up, use the trick of changing Android device orientation to landscape (and back to portrait for easier UI)
* We should not see the error Alert or error Dialog from the web app in the restarted demo app

##### Test round-trip interaction between web app and native Android functionalities
* First enter some data in web app (running in WebView); enter a Note entry
 * Select 'notepad' icon on menu bar at bottom of the WebView; touch menu icon on top right > New
 * Enter in 'Title' box, example: Ask not
 * Enter in 'Text' box, example: Therefore, send not to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.
 * Save
* Next enter a couple of contacts using the pre-loaded "People" app in Android
 * "People" app > press 'add' icon at center bottom
 * First contact: 'Name' (Enter firstname lastname), 'Phone' (Enter number, then select HOME in dropdown) > Done
 * Second contact: 'Name' (Enter firstname lastname), 'Phone' (Enter number, then select MOBILE in dropdown), 'Email' (Enter email address, then select HOME in dropdown) > Done
* Demo/Test roundtrip calling from: Android Java code, to JavaScript code in WebView, and back to Android functionality in Java code
 * Touch native Android bar-button "FETCH/SAY Note", get first note entry in web app, then hear Android say it with native TextToSpeech
* Demo/Test roundtrip calling from: JavaScript code in web app, to native Android Java code, and back to JavaScript code in web app
 * Select 'contact' icon on menu bar at bottom of the WebView; touch menu icon on top right > Fetch Contacts, call Java code to get the Android Contacts stored by the "People" app, then return the Android Contacts to JavaScript code to be stored and viewable in the web app
